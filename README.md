# ðŸŽµ Music AI

_"First, we must educate the soul through music and next the body through gymnastics" said Plato. Music has always been present in the culture of mankind. The troubadour poems, accompanied by sounds, and the symbolist poems, which aim for musicality in their creations, are examples of the artistic use of music, in which the goal is to provide pleasure to the ears and evoke feelings. Music is recognized by many researchers as a modality that develops the human mind, promotes balance, provides a pleasant state of well-being, facilitates concentration and the development of reasoning, especially in thoughtful questions. Music contains three elements: words, harmony, and rhythm. Hence the importance of good and true music. Music penetrates directly into our nerve centers and quickly and immediately orders the division of time and space, and inspires a taste for the virtues. As the children sing, they clap their hands, stamp their feet and dance. It is visible that no one remains still, that is, the natural instruments of the body itself, in their quality of primordial rhythmic gestures, complement the melodic expression of the song._
