#### _Immutability_

_-> The blockchain has several particularities, and one of them is the immutability, where there are no possibilities of changes, making the blockchain a permanent and unalterable network, thus diverging from traditional systems that are banks, concentrated in centralized authorities. Another important factor is the backups of blockchain resources, once the transactions are put into registers, there is no possibility of alteration or even going back to the operation. With this, we have a system free of corruption, where it is not possible to hack, change or even steal information._

#### _Decentralization_

_-> Everything in blockchain is very transparent and organized, which does not depend in any way on human calculations, totally intolerant to failures. We can highlight this point as one of the most beneficial of blockchain, with the decentralization, all our investors have control over their financial property, without depending on third parties or even institutions to maintain the balance of assets, the decentralized nature of the technology creates a transparent profile of each investor. Every change in blockchain is visible and makes it more concrete._

#### _Consensus_

_-> All changes are subject to a community consensus, so we pass network reliability, in a nutshell it is a decision making process for the group active in the network. Here, we can reach an agreement quickly, with the security of a system running in its core._
