# ðŸ”Š Metaverse

\-> _Imagine a world where you can sit on the same couch as a friend who lives thousands of miles away, or imagine a virtual version of your workplace while you are at the beach.The concept of the metaverse, however, emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when members of the technology community were already envisioning an Exponential Age, a future successor state to the Internet, which they called the "metaverse".In this future, only imagined at the time, the transformation of society would be so profound that it would revolutionize not only the digital world, but also much of the real world._

#### _METAVERSE and NFT Integration_

_-> It was by using blockchain to power NFTs, turning non-fungible tokens into a truly unique asset in a digital medium, that this vision of the future, the possibilities of the metaverse, truly became limitless. While many saw non-fungible tokens as a passing fad, digital industry leaders realized that, thanks to NFTs, they had finally found the missing piece for creating a "functional metaverse." A fully functional metaverse is one with the potential to fundamentally alter the way people interact with and transcend the digital world, merging it as the real world. It is a true collective virtual experience, capable of reinventing not only the creative industry, opening new doors for creators, gamers, and artists, but also providing for the physical world to integrate with the digital world, leading us, in Matthew Ball's words, to "a kind of successor to the mobile internet."_

#### _What is the role of DeFi in NFT-enabled Metarversos?_

_Coca Cola, for example, recently created its own NFTs, including a wearable jacket for avatars in the Decentraland metaverse, tapping into what the brand's global president, Selman Careaga, defined as an enthusiasm for sharing the brand's first NFTs with the metaverse, "where new friendships are being formed in new ways in new worlds." Note that while the involvement of global consumer brands via NFTs - rather than video games, sports, music and art - is not welcome in the metaverse community, this trend confirms the vision of the future envisioned by the pioneers of the digital age in the 1970s, 1980s.The metaverse, as a generational evolution of the Internet, transforming not only the virtual world, but part of the physical world, whose products and services would also come to function and be marketed on its platform. This is where decentralized finance (DeFi) fits in, in this new economy that would start to function in the metaverse; or as some say, in the "Metaverse-Fi".And what makes DeFi so attractive to the metaverse community is the fact that decentralized finance is automated, without any intervention from a central entity, in total agreement with the spirit of Web 3._

#### _Metaverse Music AI_

_We are developing our own multiverse platform, where we will have at first only one station, a station where the owners of our NFT's will be able to access and participate in decision making, like governance. But we have already started testing with games and this will only be available soon, where we will have more functionality to our metaverse. We will provide investors with several options in the MusicAI meta for technological trends and customization._
