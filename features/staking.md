# ðŸ”‰ Staking

\->_We will offer fixed interest rates to MusicAI token holders based on the staking plan they purchase. We have two staking plans available, which fully reflect the amount of tokens the user has._

#### Guidelines_**:**_

* &#x20;_Investors cannot withdraw their investment before the expiration date._
* _After the staking period has been completed, investors can withdraw their profits, which will be deposited directly into their wallets, or they can extend the staking and earn more interest._

_-> Our main goal is security, and to achieve this we will conduct constant audits to ensure the reliability of our investors._

_-> Below, we will describe the two available staking plans, which are the initial ones. We will add two more updates with new APY plans later. We will also require our partnered artists to receive a percentage of our investors' monthly fees, providing them with greater earning potential._

#### Addendum: To participate in staking, an investor must have $50 in MusicAI.

|   Tuition   | Singer | Investors |
| :---------: | :----: | :-------: |
|  $5 / month |   30%  |    10%    |
| $15 / month |   60%  |    20%    |

_Staking rewards only go to the artists they listen to. Staking reward to musician from every subscriber is calculated by A = F â‡¤ C/M â‡¤ L/365 â‡¤ (Annual rate of staking reward %) where:_&#x20;

&#x20;_A = The amount of staking reward a musician gets from one subscriber, F = Total number of tokens a subscriber stakes for subscription,_&#x20;

_C = Hours the subscriber listens to the awarded musician_&#x20;

_M = Total number of hours the subscriber listens to in each_

_L = Number of staking days._&#x20;

_**Practical example**_

* _The investor will initially contribute $50_
* _You will listen to the music of your favorite singer "A" for 40 hours_
* _You will listen to the music of your favorite singer "B" for 60 hours_
* _Singer "A" and "B", will have rights to rewards from the Investor_
* _taking into account the annual staking fee at 15% ...Singer "A" will receive 0.38 tokens from the Investor's staking and Singer "B" will receive 0.98 tokens from the Investor's staking_

_Reward tokens are minted from the reserved tokens of 50% of the initial supply_

_**Plan A**_

* _30%-will be shared between artists and listeners_&#x20;
* _30%-will be in the MusicAI fund._
* _30%-will be in the liquidity pool._
* _10%-will be burned._

_**Plan B**_

* _60%-will be shared between artists and listeners_&#x20;
* _30%-will be shared in MusicAI fund_
* _5%-will be in the liquidity pool._
* _5%-will be burned._
