# ðŸ”‰ Staking

\-> _We will offer MusicAI token holders fixed interest rates based on the staking plans purchased: We have two staking plans available, fully reflecting the amount of token users have._

_**Here are some guidelines to follow:**_

* _Investors will not be able to unwind your investment before the expiration date_&#x20;
* _After the scheduled staking has been completed, investors can withdraw their profit, which will be deposited directly into their wallets, or they can extend the staking, which will accrue interest._

_-> Our main goal in our project is security, and with this we will have constant audits that will guarantee our investors reliability._

_-> Below we will address the two possible plans, in the initial phase of the project, as we have two more updates with new APY plans. We will condition artists who partner with us to a percentage of our investors' monthly fees, giving them the possibility of even greater projections._

**Addendum: The investor to perform staking, must have $50 in MusicAI**

|   Tuition   | Singer | Investors |
| :---------: | :----: | :-------: |
|  $5 / month |   30%  |    10%    |
| $15 / month |   60%  |    20%    |

_Staking rewards only go to the artists they listen to. Staking reward to musician from every subscriber is calculated by A = F â‡¤ C/M â‡¤ L/365 â‡¤ (Annual rate of staking reward %) where:_&#x20;

&#x20;_A = The amount of staking reward a musician gets from one subscriber, F = Total number of tokens a subscriber stakes for subscription,_&#x20;

_C = Hours the subscriber listens to the awarded musician_&#x20;

_M = Total number of hours the subscriber listens to in each_

_L = Number of staking days._&#x20;

_**Practical example**_

* _The investor will initially contribute $50_
* _You will listen to the music of your favorite singer "A" for 40 hours_
* _You will listen to the music of your favorite singer "B" for 60 hours_
* _Singer "A" and "B", will have rights to rewards from the Investor_
* _taking into account the annual staking fee at 15% ...Singer "A" will receive 0.38 tokens from the Investor's staking and Singer "B" will receive 0.98 tokens from the Investor's staking_

_Reward tokens are minted from the reserved tokens of 50% of the initial supply_

_**Plan A**_

* _30%-will be shared between artists and listeners_&#x20;
* _30%-will be shared in MusicAI's fund_
* _30%-Liquidity pool_
* _10%-Burn_

_**Plan B**_

* _60%-will be shared between artists and listeners_&#x20;
* _30%-will be shared in MusicAI fund_
* _5%-Liquidity pool_
* _5%-Burn_
