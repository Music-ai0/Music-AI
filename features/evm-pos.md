# ðŸ”‰ EVM / PoS

\-> _Because we have a multi-chain, we will address the best of each blockchain segment, and in bridging the eth network, we will adopt the EVM as our execution intermediary for smart contracts._

_-> In order to be more easily interpreted to our investors, the EVM is a Decentralized CPU, where there is a collection of blockchain processes connected and encrypted in the main network, it conditions us a reading of the current state, called snapshot. With this we will run and display the speed of smart contracts, where while there is one in ethereum still active, there will continue to be an EVM for better operation, speed and security._\
_EVM makes up a robust architecture, which is a technology that makes dynamics a big boost for developers of DeFi products, with an expanded ecosystem_

_->It is also very important to highlight the role of PoS (Proof Of Stake - a consensus algorithm that randomly selects a verifier, who contributes numbers of tokens to the blockchain network to propose or validate a new block for each existing blockchain._

_-> Its importance is highlighted by the blockchain network having no competent authority to approve transactions, pro-col consensus ensures that all participants agree on a single version of the blockchain, Pow (Proff of Work) and consensus algorithms as well as PoS_
