# ðŸ”‰ EVM / PoS

\-_> We have a multi-chain approach and aim to take advantage of the best of each blockchain segment. By integrating with the Ethereum network, we will use the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as our platform for executing smart contracts._

_-> The EVM is a decentralized CPU, where a collection of blockchain processes are connected and encrypted in the main network. This allows us to read the current state, also known as a snapshot, and run and display the speed of smart contracts. As long as Ethereum remains active, there will continue to be an EVM for improved performance, speed, and security. The EVM provides a robust architecture and helps drive innovation for DeFi developers, due to its expanding ecosystem._

_-> It's important to highlight the role of Proof of Stake (PoS), a consensus algorithm that randomly selects a verifier, who contributes a certain number of tokens to the blockchain network, to propose or validate a new block._

_-> PoS is crucial because the blockchain network doesn't have a central authority to approve transactions. The consensus ensures that all participants agree on a single version of the blockchain, and consensus algorithms such as PoS and Proof of Work (PoW) play an important role._
