# ðŸ”Š DAO and Anti-Dump

#### _DAO Governance_

_-> The true nature of blockchain is decentralization, which is increasingly supported by the community. In particular, the emergence of DAOs shows the great need for transparency and decentralization, one of Music AI goals._

#### _Anti-Dump_

_-> We will have an antidumping system, where the BSC protocol determines the architectural projection of transactions and blockchain. With this, we will have 15 blocks, where there will be no transactions, and with this all negotiations will be executed via blockchain, where we have total transparency and security for our investors, a mathematical algorithm of a high level of complexity, which acts as a firewall to extinguish attacks, and if it is necessary to validate information, we have a hash, where all encrypted information is stored._
