# ðŸŽµ Sociocultural factors

\-> _One of the main reasons for the development of our project was thinking about the many artists who cannot enter the world of music through opportunity...and these opportunities are often linked to financial issues and even accessibility. An artist should be an attraction to the public just with his name, and not with a song he sings and that is making success. It is at this point that the work of a competent press office becomes more than necessary. When a song is very successful, the artist needs to immediately associate his image with it before it falls into oblivion. When choosing the artistic field as a profession, it is necessary for the artist to adapt to a system that encompasses many different areas and that undergoes continuous change. The artist who wishes to put his projects into practice knows that he will face difficulties, because the current artistic market is increasingly competitive and under-resourced, and for this reason it has become difficult to identify the place reserved for art in the current scenario._
