# ðŸŽµ Sociocultural factors

\-> _One of the main reasons behind the development of our project was to address the issue of many artists who are unable to enter the world of music due to lack of opportunity. These opportunities are often linked to financial and accessibility issues. An artist should be known to the public based on their name alone, not solely on the success of a song they perform. This is where the role of a competent press office becomes crucial. When a song becomes successful, the artist must quickly associate their image with it to prevent it from falling into obscurity. Choosing a career in the arts requires adapting to a constantly changing system that encompasses many different areas. Artists who wish to bring their projects to life are aware that they will face difficulties, as the current artistic market is increasingly competitive and under-resourced, making it difficult to find a place for art in the current landscape._
