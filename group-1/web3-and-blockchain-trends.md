# ðŸ”‰ Web3 and Blockchain Trends

_-> Objectively, Web3 can be defined as the blockchain-based generation of the Internet, whose communication network is decentralized and ownerless. Some researchers in the field use the term broadly to describe the vision of the future of the web, in which users regain control of their data and power is not concentrated in the hands of big techs.A practical example of this decentralization is the sale of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) by artists and musicians directly to their fans, without the need for an intermediary platform. Operations of this type can already be considered part of Web3, as they are done within blockchains and use cryptocurrencies as exchange._
