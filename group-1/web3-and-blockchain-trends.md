# ðŸ”‰ Web3 and Blockchain Trends

_->Objectively, Web3 can be defined as the blockchain-based generation of the internet, whose communication network is decentralized and ownerless. Some researchers in the field describe the vision of the future of the web as a place where users regain control of their data and power is not concentrated in the hands of big tech companies. A practical example of this decentralization is the direct sale of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) by artists and musicians to their fans without the need for an intermediary platform. Such operations can already be considered part of Web3, as they are conducted within blockchains and use cryptocurrencies for exchange._
