# ðŸ”Š DAO and Anti-Dump

#### DAO Governance

_-> The essence of blockchain technology is decentralization, which is increasingly embraced by the community. Specifically, the rise of DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) highlights the strong demand for transparency and decentralization, one of the main goals of Music AI._

&#x20;

#### Anti-Dump

_-> We will implement an anti-dumping system in which the BSC protocol governs the architecture of transactions and the blockchain. This system will consist of 15 blocks during which no transactions will occur. All transactions will be executed on the blockchain, providing complete transparency and security for our investors. The system also employs a high-level, complex mathematical algorithm that acts as a firewall against attacks. To validate information, we use a hash that stores all encrypted information._
