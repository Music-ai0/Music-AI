# ðŸ”‰ DeFi Concept

#### _DeFi Concept_

_-> DeFi stands for decentralized finance, which means finance that operates independently without a central authority. The concept involves financial services and products that are built on blockchain technology. A blockchain is a public database that records and stores information about financial transactions in a series of blocks. Transactions must undergo a validation process using a consensus algorithm before they can be added to the blockchain. This helps ensure the authenticity and immutability of the transaction._

#### _DeFi Functionality_

_->To understand how DeFi works, you need to know about smart contracts. These are computer codes that automatically execute agreements once specific conditions are met._

#### _Main DeFi Applications_

\-> _DeFi applications are mostly built on the Ethereum blockchain and offer various financial products and services. Some of the main applications include:_

* **C**_**rypto Exchange:** DeFi enables decentralized exchanges (DEX) where users can trade cryptocurrencies without intermediaries._
* _**P2P Lending**: DeFi offers peer-to-peer lending and borrowing of cryptocurrencies without intermediaries._
* _**Asset Tokenization:** DeFi allows the creation of digital representations of assets that have economic value and can be traded._
