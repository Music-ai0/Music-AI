# ðŸ”Š Web 3 Concept

#### _**Web 1.0** - The Beginning_

_-> The Internet was initially used for sharing technical information online and connecting it through hyperlinks, which persists today, for example, in the form of news sites that link news stories to related content. At this time, the Internet was still the exclusive domain of a few people, the connection was slow, and computers had considerably limited performance compared to what we have today. As a result, information was published in a decentralized manner, but it was still a power that only a few had. The big companies that emerged at this time were, for example, Google and Yahoo, which had the mission of organizing all the content that was available on the Internet._

#### _**Web 2.0 -** Monetization_

_-> Web 2.0 was marked by the development of digital platforms that allowed for user-generated content. The clearest example of this movement was the creation of social networks such as Orkut, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, which allowed anyone to publish videos. In addition, there was the creation of technology companies so large that they could even "monopolize" users' attention with sophisticated content recommendation algorithms and inhibit competition from rivals, such as Facebook (Meta) and Google (Alphabet) - two big techs that well symbolize the possibilities offered by Web2.0._

#### _**Web 3.0** - Blockchain_

_-> Web3 is a proposal to bring together the best of the previous two online worlds: decentralization and user-generated content, and add to all this the distributed ledger technology of blockchain. If you don't know what blockchain is, the easiest way to understand it is with the analogy of an accounting ledger, in which everything is written down in an immutable way. Each of the blocks, referred to as records, that are added to the blockchain connect to the previous one, forming a chain. This is secured using cryptography, a coding so complex that it cannot be broken by even the most advanced computers in the world. Blockchain is the link that connects Web3 to cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The decentralization of finance is achieved by relegating the storage of information, whether financial or otherwise, to the blockchain._\
