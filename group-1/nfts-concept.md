# ðŸ”‰ NFT's Concept

## _Non-Interchangeable Tokens (NFT)_&#x20;

_-> Use cryptocurrency technology to create unique digital assets. It is possible to register ownership of collectibles, real estate, and even game characters with their respective scores, items, and the like.This market has grown exponentially in recent months, and we have even had sales at the world's most traditional auction house, Christie's of London. Those who buy NFT seek exclusivity and status._

_-> The NFT, or non-fungible token, is a digital record of ownership of a particular asset, whether real or virtual. Token means cryptoactive, a digital asset that exists only within a shared database. Assets, digital or otherwise, can be classified into two groups:_

_**Fungible, which can be replaced or divided without loss of value.**_&#x20;

* _money;_&#x20;
* _bitcoin;_&#x20;
* _Fraction of a piece of land;_&#x20;
* _Fan tokens;_&#x20;
* _oil;_&#x20;

#### _Non-fungible, where each item is unique, and non-divisible._&#x20;

* _Lot A-32 of the Alphaville 4 condominium;_&#x20;
* _A certain seat for a theater or show;_&#x20;
* _10/100 copy of a work of art;_&#x20;
* _Autographed baseball card;_&#x20;
* _User @tuba33play of the game Dota II;_&#x20;
* _Bronze medal of boxer Abner Teixeira._

#### _How to invest in NFT?_

_-> The first thing an investor of non-interchangeable tokens needs to understand is that trading involves only one record in the shared database, the blockchain. In other words, the copyright of the item is not being traded._\
_****Thus, by investing in NFT of a digital artwork you are buying the right to a "certified copy", recognized by the artist. It is up to you to make sure that the item is authorized by its creator._\
_There are several marketplaces for NFTs, including OpenSea, Nifty Gateway, Rarible, SuperRare, and others. In addition to acting as a virtual art gallery, it allows artists to create non-interchangeable tokens without the need for programming or knowledge of cryptography._

#### Integration of NFT's with Music AI

_-> We will develop a totally special collection for our investors, where at first we will make a sale of our instrument collection, with everything we will condition future opportunities already in development to the possibility of creating our own NFT's or even the creation of consolidated artist's NFT's, this is a process in which we will use artificial intelligence to our advantage, below some examples of future collections and the opensea link with a collection already available for sale! totally exclusive._

_-> This available collection will have several benefits, including the inclusion in events that we are on the roadmap to integrate our partners and investors who have purchased our NFT's. A unique opportunity to be all together and discuss all MusicAI updates._

_-> Initially we will have 19 unique NFT's as per the model below._
