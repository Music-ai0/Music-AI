#### _Immutability_

_-> The blockchain has several unique features, and one of them is immutability, where there is no possibility of changes. This makes the blockchain a permanent and unalterable network, which differs from traditional centralized systems like banks. Another important factor is the backup of blockchain resources. Once transactions are recorded, they cannot be altered or undone. This creates a system that is immune to corruption and information cannot be hacked, changed, or stolen._

The decentralized nature of the technology creates a transparent profile of each investor. Every change in the blockchain is visible, making it more solid._

#### _Consensus_

_->All changes are subject to a community consensus, which ensures network reliability. In a nutshell, this is a decision-making process for the active group in the network. Here, we can reach an agreement quickly and with the security of a well-functioning system at its core._
